# scriban [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ig5kv8r63bqjsd9a?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xoofx/scriban)   [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Scriban.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scriban/)

Scriban is a fast, powerful and lightweight text templating language and engine for .NET

```C#
var template = Template.Parse("Hello {{name}}!")
template.Render(new { name = "foo" }); // => "hi foo!" 
```

The language is very versatile and easy to read and use, similar to Liquid but more powerful:

```C#
var template = Template.Parse(@"
<ul id='products'>
  {{ for product in products }}
    <li>
      <h2>{{ product.name }}</h2>
           Price: {{ product.price }}
           {{ product.description | string.truncate 15 }}
    </li>
  {{ end }}
</ul>
");
var result = template.Render(new { products = this.ProductList });
```

## Features

Scriban is similar to [liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) or [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) but provides additional support for:

- Very efficient and fast parser (no regexp) with lightweight runtime. CPU and Garbage Collector friendly. Check the benchmarks below.
- Real Lexer/Parser providing a **full Abstract Syntax Tree, fast, versatile and robust**, more efficient than a regex based parser.
- [Precise control of whitespace text output](doc/language.md#14-whitespace-control)
- Full featured language including `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`, [expressions](doc/language.md#8-expressions) (`x = 1 + 2`), conditions... etc.
- [function call and pipes](doc/language.md#88-function-call-expression) (`myvar | string.capitalize`)
- [Complex objects](doc/language.md#5-objects) (javascript/json like objects `x = {mymember: 1}`) and [arrays](doc/language.md#6-arrays) (e.g `x = [1,2,3,4]`)
- [Custom functions](doc/language.md#7-functions) directly into the language via `func` statement and allow **function pointers/delegates** via the `alias @ directive`
  - But also easily bind [.NET custom functions](doc/runtime.md#imports-functions-from-a-net-class) from the runtime API with [many options](doc/runtime.md#the-scriptobject) for interfacing with .NET objects.
- Allow to pass [a block of statements](doc/language.md#98-wrap-function-arg1argn--end) to a function, typically used by the `wrap` statement
- Several builtins objects/functions:
  - [`arrays functions`](doc/language.md#101-array-functions)
  - [`maths functions`](doc/language.md#102-math-functions)
  - [`string functions`](doc/language.md#103-string-functions)
  - [`regex functions`](doc/language.md#104-regex)
  - [`date`](doc/language.md#106-datetime)/[`time`](doc/language.md#107-timespan)
- [Multi-line statements](doc/language.md#11-code-block) without having to embrace each line by `{{...}}`
- Safe language and runtime, allowing you to control what objects and functions are exposed
